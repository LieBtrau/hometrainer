===Version 0===
 This version was the first trial version.  It has some problems:

 * It works only for supply voltages of 3.3V and higher.  For lower supply voltages, the GPIO voltage of the Arduino (V_ol) is smaller than the input voltage for a high level (V_ih) on the LCD.  A voltage level translation circuit consisting of a pull-up and an NMOS solves the problem.
 * SMD components were placed on top side, through hole components on bottom side so that routing could be done on top layer, whilst keeping a full ground plane on top side.  The problem here was that some SMD components were too high and touch the LCD module when the board is mounted in the chassis.

===Version 1===
 This version solves the issues of the version 0 PCB.
  
 * It's not code-compatible.  Two GPIO lines of the MCU have been switched because it was easier to rout the tracks on the PCB.
